# =============================================================================
# HARDCORE MODE (EXPERIMENTAL - NOT YET IMPLEMENTED)
# =============================================================================
# Enable at your own risk! This is a high-stakes game mode.
#
# HARDCORE_MODE=false
#
# When HARDCORE_MODE is enabled:
#
# CHARACTER DEATH:
#   - When your character dies, the account is PERMANENTLY DELETED
#   - All memory files (item memory, location memory) are erased
#   - The account.env file is removed
#   - There is NO recovery, NO appeals, NO second chances
#
# ITEM PERSISTENCE:
#   - Items dropped on death stay on the ground FOREVER
#   - Unlike normal mode where items despawn after ~60 seconds
#   - Items accumulate in death locations ("graveyards")
#   - Anyone can pick up items from the ground
#
# ITEM BURNING:
#   - Items can ONLY be removed by lighting a fire on top of them
#   - When a fire is lit on a tile with items:
#     - Items burn one at a time
#     - Each item takes 2 seconds to burn
#     - The burner gains firewood XP for each item destroyed
#     - Items burn in order: least valuable first
#   - This creates a "janitor" role: cleaning up death piles for XP
#
# SOCIAL DYNAMICS:
#   - Death locations become known and marked
#   - Players may camp death spots waiting for gear
#   - "Vulture" behavior emerges (waiting for deaths)
#   - "Janitor" characters can clean up areas for XP
#   - Gear inflation in the economy (items leave circulation slowly)
#
# RECOMMENDED ONLY FOR:
#   - Hardcore permadeath servers
#   - High-stakes roleplay communities
#   - Players who enjoy true risk/reward
