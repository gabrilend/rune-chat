NPCs should spawn on the exact distance that is the black border of the map (the edge of the
client's visible area), rather than a fixed 8-15 tile radius.

the city guards should always spawn in their default locations (and others? like inside of the city
going on patrol walk down the streets in groups of two or three)

the kings should attract monsters from outside of their town, who the guards intercept

the level of the monsters depends on the average level of the players inside of their castle.
minimum, the highest level of their guards. but, they don't heal, so any damage done is damage done.

guards should spawn based on the amount of items sold to stores in the town. The more gold produced in the player's inventory, the closer to another guard spawn. Higher level guards cost more gold, but stick around and fight monsters for longer.

runecrafting altars should enchant whatever items the user is wearing. the enchantment spell is
chosen based on the nature of the altar in question - an altar in the wind and ice would probably
enchant diamond jewelry, while the sapphire altar might be underwater. Each of the elemental altars
have conditions that describe their home and nature, and the enchantment spell for them is chosen
based on this character.

however, when a character dies, all their equipment becomes unenchanted.
